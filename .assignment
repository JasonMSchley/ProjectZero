Project 0 - I (Due 18 October 11:59 PM Eastern)
(This will be the first part of an ongoing, more extensive individual project. Keep this in mind as the foundation you build here will need to support future endeavors.)

You will determine a business you want to model. This can be an actual company or one you create.

Lightning Web Components Open Source
You will use the LWC OSS framework to create a webpage for the company you've chosen. This webpage should consist of multiple Lightning web components that respond to user input. Additionally, one or more components must make use of conditional rendering.

Styling
Your webpage must be well-styled with a uniform design. This can be accomplished through the use of custom CSS or SLDS classes.

Git & Github

Your code should be routinely pushed to a Github repository that your trainer has access to.
