Hello my name is Jason Schley
As a salesforce developer for my Project Zero i created a Coffee wholsaler
I personally dont drink coffee but i can see that its very popular
I created a prototype of their web page using Lightning web components
In future versions i am plan to add a link allowing end users to submit their own purchase order requests


Within the org, the main user works within operations and has the most restrictions 
and in order to minimize my license uses im going to pretend to be them.

As the front facing roll their job is primarily to enter purchase orders and update contact information, 

and if the order is large enough to send a authorization request to handle using pallets
and some automation through workflows

they are also able to create and update contacts including entering in new credit cards, which are then sent to accounting for final verification.

I setup this app to make it easier for them to see the orders that has been created but hasnt been finalized.

second user is accounting, or CFO
their primary role is in dealing with money which includes approval requests regarding money such as the credit card authorization. 

Third position i created was the operations manager, which im going to pretend to be, is the only one able to create or enter new products into the system





With that i conclude my presentation and open up for questions.
